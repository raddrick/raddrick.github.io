So, today has been extraordinarily awesome, so awesome in fact that I feel it's prudent I record it some how, I don't blog, or preach on Facebook, but I kind of look at Instagram as a sort of timeline to my life, and since it's been a part of the awesomeness, I will go ahead and drop it here... Yes, I realize how much typing I've done and haven't even begun to list them off, so without further adieu, here we go.

1. Slept like a fucking rock last night, I was easily up until 2am on the grind, but I woke up just 5 minutes before my alarm clock this morning regardless

2. I set up my laptop with the old rise and grind mindset, not realizing how productive today would actually be, I didn't have coffee in, the house, but there was a #redbull kicking around from last night, so it served as a suitable substitute.

3. My roommate came home with the old #strideofpride and we planned to hit up #lepaqlepaq for brunch, it's just around the corner from my place and it makes for a great #workspace any day of the week. Since we had a couple hours to kill before the doors opened, and I was on the red bull in #gameon mode, he was like, imma crash fer a bit (in so many words)

4. I spend the next couple hours managing my team on one project while I worked some tasks on another like it wasn't my first day (it wasnt, but today it was even more apparent than usual)

5. We breach the 11am mark, and I start thinking about my desire fore coffee and brunch to the point where I started seeding my roomie Bitmojis in the form of "wake up foo, it's #brunch time."...Silence. So I make the executive decision to leave his ass in bed and step up to the plate.

6. I get to lepaq lepaq, and I see there are a couple fellow remotes sitting next to the table which I would easily consider to be my favorite one in the two story industrial style cafe. Sweet. So I set up, order my first coffee of the day (which is always the sweetest, but not literally because I drink it black) and my #bigbaby, which I'm not a fan of ordering because there is a #bigdaddy on the menu, and I'm a giant, so you can imagine how counterintuitive it is for me to say "I'll have the bigbabby please" it's pretty on point though
