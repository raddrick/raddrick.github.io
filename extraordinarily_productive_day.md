So, today has been extraordinarily awesome. so awesome in fact that I feel it's prudent I record it some how, I don't blog, or preach on Facebook, but I kind of look at Instagram as a sort of timeline to my life, and since it's been a part of the awesomeness, I will go ahead and drop it here... Yes, I realize how much typing I've done and haven't even begun to list them off, so without further adieu, here we go.

1. Slept like a fucking rock last night, I was easily up until 2am on the grind, but I woke up just 5 minutes before my alarm clock this morning regardless

2. I set up my laptop with the old rise and grind mindset, not realizing how productive today would actually be, I didn't have coffee in, the house, but there was a #redbull kicking around from last night, so it served as a suitable substitute.

3. My roommate came home with the old #strideofpride and we planned to hit up #lepaqlepaq for brunch, it's just around the corner from my place and it makes for a great #workspace any day of the week. Since we had a couple hours to kill before the doors opened, and I was on the red bull in #gameon mode, he was like, imma crash fer a bit (in so many words)

4. I spend the next couple hours managing my team on one project while I worked some tasks on another like it wasn't my first day (it wasnt, but today it was even more apparent than usual)

5. We breach the 11am mark, and I start thinking about my desire fore coffee and brunch to the point where I started seeding my roomie Bitmojis in the form of "wake up foo, it's #brunch time."...Silence. So I make the executive decision to leave his ass in bed and step up to the plate.

6. I get to lepaq lepaq, and I see there are a couple fellow remotes sitting next to the table which I would easily consider to be my favorite one in the two story industrial style cafe. Sweet. So I set up, order my first coffee of the day (which is always the sweetest, but not literally because I drink it black) and my #bigbaby, which I'm not a fan of ordering because there is a #bigdaddy on the menu, and I'm a giant, so you can imagine how counterintuitive it is for me to say "I'll have the big baby please" it's pretty on point (at this point I have discovered the word limit to Instagram, so fuck it, as of today, I blog too.)

7. I enjoy first few sips of coffee with my fellow remotes from Remote Year Magellan, and while I do I recieve a message on whatsapp from a CEO in my network. He employs a couple of my favorite students from my Code Core days in Vancouver, and he tells me that the technical lead wants to start me up on this new project team that he is building for another product that they have coming together with their remote team (he already knows my terms and conditions, no contract to speak of, no "haggling" of sorts, just "Lets get started tomorrow". Ok, "a bit pushy, but OK" I think to myself, "I'll talk to your guy tomorrow, no problem". I had bigger fish to fry at the time, brunch had arrived just then. So I havent even had breakfast yet, and I have a pretty amazing job opportunity that is remote, at a good rate, in my home town, working with some of my favorite devs. DECENT start.

8. One thing I have learned here in Malaysia, is something that is funny because the words are a bit lost in translation. The city managers here in Kuala Lumpur are easily my favorite so far. The joke about how we take pictures of all the amazing things we eat while exploring new cities and say "The camera always eats first!", today was no exception. ![It's the most important meal of the day #brunch #digitalnomad #workspaceoftheday](https://instagram.fkul10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/e35/16123159_1234547673291104_3820223098821541888_n.jpg)[see it here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPbvB1UDnRy/) nothing fancy, right? I didnt think so...so I put down my phone, and enjoy! ...cus its getting cold.

9. My fellow remotes head off on their merry way, I finish up my breakfast, and continue my rise and grind session that I started earlier in the day. My team working on one product while I can focus on the other.  My roommate (who I actually took the photo for to show him what he was missing out on) still M.I.A. as it turns out to be a good thing I didnt wait for him because he apparently ended up going to the movies with his accomplice from the night before.

10. Focus. Power. I completed a pretty major task on what I was working on, as far as Im concerned, I've adulted enough today...here in Malaysia it tends to rain a lot, we are basically right next to a rainforest where we live, and as I looked up into the ominous sky, the sounds of Christroper Robins rang in my mind. "It looks like rain"

11. I pack up, pay the bill for my lovely breakfast, much needed coffee, and a bit extra for the usage of such a lovely space, and head back to my apartment. just as I sit down in my living room, a torrential down pour falls. Just outside the window, the views of the KL Tower are almost non existant! This is the sight I usually get from my apartment window (https://instagram.fkul10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/s640x640/e15/15624897_1195815353873270_8324106752379322368_n.jpg) Feeling accomplished, and dry thankfully, I head into the kitchen where I have some leftovers from the night before which i had intended on consuming the night before (hence the stash of redbulls that I was able to take advantage of today! I swear, this isnt a redbull commercial, but it may have given me wings today) On the menu for lunch was white rice, chicken wings, and a couple styles of [Sambal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambal) which is the one and only reason for bringing home the rice...as a deliver method for the sambal. It is, so far, my favorite Malaysian food-thing. B-O-M-B. It's spicy, sweet, tangy and salty. Like, for realsies.

12. After enjoying my meal in the living room, I lie back on the couch looking out into the monsoon that is falling outside of my window, and I being to doze off...If I learned anything from living in spain, its that adults can have naptime too. so, I do not resist, in any way. It is nap time. I fall asleep for maybe an hour or so. and when I wake up, I look down upon my phone, which I had lying on my chest, and to my surprise, I have upwards of 100 new followers on my IG. My reaction to something that has never happened to me was pretty standard, I was like "whaaaa?". My usual response to new followers is to to check them out and decide If they're worth a follow back. Its not often that theyre all good for me, but this bunch were, mostly travllers and nomads, so I give them the +1. this continues for the rest of the day. I started this day with just over 500 followers...so you can imagine when im at a 20% increase over nap time...like, thats a pretty productive nap I'd say.

13. While reviewing my likes/comments/follows like I have never done so before, I cant help but wonder "WTF, did I get featured somewhere without being notified??" TBD, but I notice in those comments that someone had asked to feature me on one of their new projects [The Random Passion Project](http://www.therandomp.com), A new endeavour by another digital nomad featuring digital nomad stories, and she wants to do a write up on me and my story, flattered, I did what any dork with too many new followers would do, "uhh yea! obvi". Stay tuned for that one..

15. So, the rain has subsided, and I start to get in gear to head to the office, I head out the door and just as I do, one of the city managers drives up in his car. Conviently because he has a trunk full of goods that we picked up the night before to take into the workspace. "Its a good thing I saw you, i was about to get into PJ mode and theres no way i would be going to the office later. Hop in". by this time, its about 5:30, rush hour, but luckily i didnt have to trek in the humidity, i just had to endure rush hour of Khuala Lumpur, which is no small feat, thanks to A/C for being there in my times of need. I swear if i was made of sugar, I would melt in this country.

14. Here in KL, all the groups that have come through (we are the 4th at our workspace, funnily enough because we are RY4) have done a mural in the workspace, Libertatum hired this badass graffitti artist to do a Pheonix in the first spot, my homies over in Batutta did a cool tribute to their explorers origins, and the Cousteaus, who Im sure are very nice but I havent had the pleasure of meeting any of them yet (TODO, meet some Cousteaus) did a tribute to their explorer in a rather cartoony fashion (not my description, but I'm going to roll with it) So we have been scheming about what we should do for our mural.  I was inspired after reading Magellans wiki page, learning about his circumnavigation, and their trials and tribulations and saw a lot of parallels between his journey and our own. If you know me, you know that i was born in the wrong era and was clearly meant to be the captian of a pirate crew, but here I am, a non conformist computer geek (its a pretty difficult dichotomy to manage from day to day, but hey, what can I do aboot it? ![Yarrr](https://instagram.fkul10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p750x750/13741249_231100503950634_1939001834_n.jpg) Stay tuned for more on the mural! 

15. We arrive at the office, and I realize that I am running out of time to send off some postcards that I should have sent off in the previous month, but luckily a fellow remote was heading back that way, so I needed to act fast. Check! Another thing off the list today, more awesome...[![Rick Graham's GoFundMe Campaign]](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JhiEp7nGXFs/2.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JhiEp7nGXFs)

16. As I prep for paint, we begin to setup a bit of a theater setup in the kitchen area of the workspace to watch movies, essentailly to keep us company while we paint.  On the docket, Star Wars, believe it or not, there are some who havent seen them yet? I personally cant immagine that since ive watched them all a billion times, but like always I am game for it. The assistant city manager is all about it, he actually talks about it all the time, its crazy how obsessed he is with it, haha i like him though, we start with A New Hope and quckly bail for Empire Strikes Back..I always want to watch them in order, but ive seen them before, so he makes a good point about the Vader surprise (no spoilers) But first, "sushi anyone?"

17. After the sushi, we press play and I get my paint on ![earth without art is just EH](https://scontent.fkul10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16143163_10154578127154821_3840203897256741726_n.jpg). We get a primer layer down, and two base coats of the mural background color down, ready for day two. In that time we get through Episode 5, and I finally convince him to let me put on Episode 1. Frankly, I dont care if you don't like Jar Jar, I want to watch Darth Maul get slain!

18. By this time, its about 3am, I dont think i have ever gotten this much done in a day. my phone has been freakishly going off all day with new followers, likes, and comments. even as I write this they are coming in, I have easily, in one day, doubled my followers and I have no idea why! (From just over 500 to 1020 as I write this)
